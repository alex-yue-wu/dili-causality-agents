Case presentation An 18-year-old iranian woman was admitted to the hos- pital with jaundice, anorexia, and severe fatigue. She had no history of underlying disease, alcohol consump- tion, or herbal medicine use. The patient complained of alopecia areata, and tofacitinib (5 mg twice a day) was administered for disease management. Following 2 months of adherence to tofacitinib medication, partial recovery was obtained. However, after 2 months of tofacitinib administration, the patient developed jaun- dice, anorexia, and severe fatigue. At the time of hospi- talization, the patient had a stable condition and only anorexia, jaundice, and fatigue were reported. The patient had no history of liver disease, and liver function tests were normal before starting tofacitinib. The patient’s laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient’s laboratory test results showed elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1000 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1500 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 400 U/L, total bilirubin 10 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin 6 mg/dL. The patient’s international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.2. The patient’s complete blood count (CBC) was normal. The patient’s viral hepatitis markers, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb), and hepatitis A virus antibody (HAVAb), were negative. The patient’s autoimmune markers, including antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), were also negative. The patient’s ceruloplasmin level was normal. The patient’s abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Based on the patient’s clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and the use of tofacitinib, a diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was made. Tofacitinib was discontinued, and the patient was started on supportive care. The patient’s liver function tests gradually improved, and she was discharged from the hospital after 10 days. The patient’s liver function tests returned to normal within 2 months of discontinuing tofacitinib. The patient was followed up for 6 months, and her liver function tests remained normal.
