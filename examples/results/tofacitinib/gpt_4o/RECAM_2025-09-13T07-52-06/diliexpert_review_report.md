Unfortunately, I do not have the capability to extract data from the provided PDF document directly, nor have I been given access to it. Consequently, I cannot verify the data or format the requested analysis in the required markdown format, as no specific content from the PDF is available. To continue, I would need additional, accessible details regarding the RECAM-based causality assessment from the PDF.

However, if there are specific data points or findings that you can share from the report, I can certainly help format these into the markdown structure you've outlined and provide a comprehensive summary based on those insights. Please provide any relevant details you have access to or let me know how else I might assist you.
