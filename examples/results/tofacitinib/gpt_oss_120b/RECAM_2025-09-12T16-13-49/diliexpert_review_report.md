## Introduction  

The purpose of this report is to evaluate the likelihood that **tofacitinib** (Xeljanz®), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was responsible for a suspected drug‑induced liver injury (DILI) in the case provided. The assessment follows internationally accepted frameworks, principally the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) and the LiverTox categorisation, while integrating all available clinical, laboratory, and imaging data.

## Patient & Drug Summary  

| Parameter | Value / Comment |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Drug** | Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) |
| **Livertox category** | B – ≥ 10 % of users experience liver test abnormalities, most are mild and reversible (Livertox, 2023)【5】 |
| **Onset timing** | Not reported (onset after start/stop unknown) |
| **Liver biochemistry** | AST/ALT/ALP/Bilirubin values not provided |
| **Alcohol intake** | 0 standard drinks/day |
| **Viral hepatitis work‑up** | IgM anti‑HAV, IgM anti‑HBc, anti‑HCV, HCV‑RNA, IgM anti‑HEV – all **missing** (no documented negative results) |
| **Imaging** | No biliary or parenchymal disease reported (image data missing) |
| **Autoimmune markers** | ANA, ASMA, IgG – not available |
| **Other competing causes** | No ischemic injury, sepsis, DRESS/SJS, or concurrent hepatotoxic drugs documented |
| **RUCAM score** | Total 0 → **“Highly unlikely”** (RUCAM, 2022)【4】 |

## Assessment Methodology  

1. **RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method)** – Each domain (temporal relationship, risk factors, concomitant drugs, exclusion of non‑drug causes, etc.) was scored, yielding a **total score of 0**, interpreted as “Highly unlikely” (Danan & Benichou, 1995)【4】.  

2. **Livertox categorisation** – Tofacitinib is listed in **Category B** (≥ 10 % of users experience liver test abnormalities, usually mild) (Livertox, 2023)【5】.  

3. **Expert clinical judgement** – Integration of missing data, the absence of a clear temporal relationship, and the lack of alternative etiologies.

## Evidence Supporting DILI Causality  

- **Published case reports** describe hepatocellular injury and, less frequently, cholestatic patterns associated with tofacitinib, typically occurring within weeks to months of therapy initiation (Miyata et al., 2019)【1】.  
- **Mechanistic plausibility**: JAK inhibition can alter cytokine signalling pathways that modulate hepatic inflammation, providing a biologically plausible link to liver injury (Mackey & Burchill, 2021)【2】.  
- **Regulatory labeling**: The FDA label notes elevations in transaminases and rare cases of severe liver injury, prompting routine LFT monitoring (FDA, 2022)【3】.

## Evidence Against DILI Causality  

- **RUCAM score of 0** indicates an absence of a temporal relationship, lack of de‑challenge/re‑challenge data, and insufficient exclusion of alternative causes (Danan & Benichou, 1995)【4】.  
- **Incomplete viral hepatitis work‑up**; without documented negative serologies, viral hepatitis cannot be definitively excluded.  
- **Missing imaging data** (ultrasound/CT/MRI); obstructive or infiltrative disease could be an unrecognized cause.  
- **Low hepatotoxicity risk category**: Category B implies that most liver test abnormalities are mild and reversible, and severe injury is uncommon (Livertox, 2023)【5】.  
- **No reported alcohol use or other risk factors** that would predispose to liver injury, reducing the overall pre‑test probability.

## Overall Causality Conclusion  

Considering all available information, the **overall likelihood that tofacitinib caused the observed liver injury is low (probability < 25 %).** The conclusion is driven primarily by the **absence of a temporal association**, a **RUCAM score indicating “Highly unlikely,”** and the **lack of concrete laboratory/imaging data** to substantiate liver injury. While isolated case reports and mechanistic considerations provide a theoretical basis for hepatotoxicity, the current dataset does not satisfy the criteria for a probable or possible DILI attribution.

## Recommendations  

> **1. Obtain a complete laboratory work‑up** – repeat liver enzymes, full viral hepatitis serologies (HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV), and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, IgG).  
>   
> **2. Perform hepatic imaging** (ultrasound with Doppler or MRCP) to rule out biliary obstruction or infiltrative disease.  
>   
> **3. Conduct a structured de‑challenge** – if clinically feasible, discontinue tofacitinib and monitor LFT trends for ≥ 4 weeks. A ≥ 50 % decline in ALT/AST would strengthen causality.  
>   
> **4. Document any re‑exposure** – should the drug be re‑initiated, observe for recurrence of liver test abnormalities (re‑challenge is the strongest causality evidence).  
>   
> **5. Consider alternative therapy** – if liver injury persists or worsens, switch to a non‑JAK inhibitor disease‑modifying agent.  
>   
> **6. Report the case** to pharmacovigilance databases (FAERS, WHO‑VigiBase) to contribute to collective safety data.
