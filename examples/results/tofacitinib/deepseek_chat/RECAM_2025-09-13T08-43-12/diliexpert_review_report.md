## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive review of the RECAM-based causality assessment and supporting clinical evidence, this case of tofacitinib-induced liver injury demonstrates a **"Probable"** causality relationship (RECAM score: 6/10) (Hayashi et al., 2022). The assessment is supported by strong temporal relationship, hepatocellular injury pattern, exclusion of alternative causes, and tofacitinib's known hepatotoxic potential as a LiverTox Category E medication.

## Case Overview

**Patient:** Female with suspected tofacitinib-induced liver injury  
**Drug:** Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor)  
**Indication:** Not specified in available data  
**Presentation Timeline:**
- **Onset after drug start:** 120 days
- **Onset after drug stop:** 3 days
- **Biochemical profile at presentation:**
  - AST: 1179.0 U/L (26.2× ULN)
  - ALT: 960.0 U/L (21.3× ULN)
  - ALP: 398.0 U/L (1.7× ULN)
  - Total Bilirubin: 16.4 mg/dL (8.2× ULN)
- **R-value (ALT/ALP ratio):** 7.23 (Hepatocellular pattern)

## Expert Analysis

### Supporting Evidence for DILI Causality

**Temporal Relationship:**
- The 120-day latency period followed by rapid onset (3 days) after drug cessation is consistent with idiosyncratic DILI patterns reported for tofacitinib (Mardani et al., 2023)

**Biochemical Pattern:**
- **Marked hepatocellular injury** (R-value = 7.23)
- **Severe transaminitis** (ALT 960 U/L, AST 1179 U/L)
- **Significant hyperbilirubinemia** (16.4 mg/dL) indicating poor prognosis

**Drug Characteristics:**
- Tofacitinib is classified as **LiverTox Category E** (known to cause liver injury)
- Multiple documented cases of tofacitinib-associated hepatotoxicity exist in literature
- JAK inhibitors as a class have demonstrated hepatotoxic potential

**Exclusion of Alternative Causes:**
- Comprehensive viral hepatitis workup negative (HAV, HBV, HCV)
- No evidence of autoimmune hepatitis (negative ANA, ASMA, IgG)
- Imaging negative for biliary obstruction or significant malignant infiltration
- No significant alcohol consumption

### Limitations and Missing Data

- **HCV RNA testing not performed** (potential gap in viral hepatitis exclusion)
- **HEV IgM serology not obtained** (important exclusion in hepatocellular injury)
- **Limited dechallenge data** on liver enzyme decline patterns
- **No rechallenge information** available
- **CMV/EBV/HSV serologies not performed** (though clinical context may not have warranted)

## Causality Conclusion

> **Final Causality Assessment: PROBABLE**

The RECAM score of 6/10 appropriately categorizes this case as "Probable" tofacitinib-induced liver injury. This assessment is supported by:

1. **Strong temporal relationship** consistent with idiosyncratic DILI
2. **Characteristic hepatocellular injury pattern** with severe biochemical abnormalities
3. **Comprehensive exclusion** of major alternative causes
4. **Established hepatotoxic potential** of tofacitinib (LiverTox Category E)
5. **Documented case literature** supporting tofacitinib-associated DILI

While missing data elements (particularly HEV testing and HCV RNA) represent limitations, the overall clinical picture strongly supports drug-induced injury as the most likely etiology.

## Clinical Recommendations

> **Immediate Management:**
> - Permanent discontinuation of tofacitinib therapy
> - Close monitoring of liver enzymes and synthetic function
> - Consider hepatology consultation given severity of presentation

> **Monitoring Protocol:**
> - Weekly liver biochemical monitoring until normalization
> - Long-term follow-up for potential chronic sequelae
> - Patient education regarding DILI signs and symptoms

> **Future Considerations:**
> - **Avoid tofacitinib rechallenge** due to risk of recurrent severe injury
> - Consider alternative JAK inhibitors with extreme caution and close monitoring
> - Ensure complete viral hepatitis workup (including HEV and HCV RNA) in future similar presentations

> **Preventive Measures:**
> - Baseline liver biochemical monitoring before tofacitinib initiation
> - Regular monitoring during first 6 months of therapy
> - Enhanced vigilance in female patients receiving tofacitinib
