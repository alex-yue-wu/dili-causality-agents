## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive causality assessment of suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) associated with tofacitinib therapy. Using the Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method (RECAM), the case scores **6 points**, corresponding to a **"Probable"** causality assessment (Hayashi et al., 2022). The assessment is based on temporal relationship, hepatocellular injury pattern, exclusion of alternative causes, and known hepatotoxic potential of tofacitinib.

## Case Presentation

A female patient developed clinically apparent liver injury following tofacitinib therapy with the following characteristics:

- **Drug:** Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor)
- **Indication:** Not specified in available data
- **Onset after start:** 120 days
- **Onset after stop:** 3 days
- **Liver biochemistry at presentation:**
  - AST: 1179.0 U/L
  - ALT: 960.0 U/L  
  - ALP: 398.0 U/L
  - Total Bilirubin: 16.4 mg/dL
- **R-value (ALT/ALP ratio):** 7.23 (Hepatocellular pattern)

---

## RECAM Causality Assessment

### Overall Score: 6/10 (Probable)

**Domain Scores:**
- **Domain 1 (Temporal Relationship):** 2 points
  - Onset after drug start: >90 days (0 points)
  - Onset after drug stop: â‰¤30 days (0 points)
- **Domain 2 (Dechallenge/Washout):** 1 point
  - Limited dechallenge data available
- **Domain 3 (Drug-Specific Risk):** 3 points
  - Tofacitinib: LiverTox Category E (known hepatotoxic drug)
- **Domain 4 (Exclusion of Competing Diagnoses):** 0 points
  - Comprehensive exclusion of alternative causes
- **Domain 5 (Additional Data):** 0 points
  - No rechallenge or biopsy data available

---

## Supporting Evidence

### Temporal Relationship
- Liver injury manifested 120 days after drug initiation and 3 days after drug discontinuation, consistent with reported latency patterns for tofacitinib-induced DILI (Mardani et al., 2023)

### Biochemical Pattern
- **Hepatocellular injury pattern** (R-value = 7.23)
- Marked transaminase elevation (ALT 960 U/L, AST 1179 U/L)
- Significant hyperbilirubinemia (16.4 mg/dL) indicating severe injury

### Drug Characteristics
- Tofacitinib is classified as **LiverTox Category E** (known to cause liver injury)
- Multiple case reports document tofacitinib-associated hepatotoxicity (Mardani et al., 2023)
- JAK inhibitors as a class have documented hepatotoxic potential

### Demographic Factors
- Female gender (increased susceptibility to DILI)
- No significant alcohol consumption

## Alternative Causes Excluded

Comprehensive evaluation ruled out other potential causes of liver injury:

- **Viral Hepatitis:** 
  - HAV (IgM anti-HAV negative)
  - HBV (HBsAg negative, IgM anti-HBc negative)
  - HCV (anti-HCV negative)
  - HEV (not tested - limitation)

- **Autoimmune Hepatitis:**
  - Negative autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, IgG)

- **Biliary Disease:**
  - Imaging negative for biliary obstruction or strictures

- **Other Causes:**
  - No evidence of ischemic hepatitis
  - No sepsis documented
  - No malignant infiltration (>50%)
  - No significant alcohol consumption

---

## Limitations

- **Missing Data:**
  - HCV RNA not tested
  - HEV IgM not tested
  - CMV/EBV/HSV serologies not performed
  - Limited dechallenge response data

- **No Rechallenge:** Lack of prospective rechallenge data limits definitive causality confirmation

- **Histological Data:** Liver biopsy not performed, limiting pathological correlation

---

## Clinical Implications

Tofacitinib-induced liver injury, while relatively uncommon, can present with severe hepatocellular injury and jaundice. This case demonstrates:

- Delayed onset (120 days) consistent with idiosyncratic DILI
- Rapid manifestation after drug cessation (3 days)
- Potential for severe biochemical abnormalities
- Importance of ongoing liver monitoring during tofacitinib therapy

> **Clinical Alert:** Patients receiving tofacitinib require regular liver biochemical monitoring, particularly during the first 6 months of therapy and with any dose changes.

---

## Recommendations

> **1. Immediate Management:**
> - Permanent discontinuation of tofacitinib
> - Close monitoring of liver enzymes and synthetic function
> - Supportive care with consideration for specialist referral

> **2. Future Considerations:**
> - Avoid tofacitinib rechallenge due to risk of recurrent injury
> - Consider alternative JAK inhibitors with caution
> - Patient education regarding DILI signs and symptoms

> **3. Monitoring Protocol:**
> - Weekly liver biochemical tests until normalization
> - Consider hepatology consultation for persistent abnormalities
> - Long-term follow-up for potential chronic sequelae
