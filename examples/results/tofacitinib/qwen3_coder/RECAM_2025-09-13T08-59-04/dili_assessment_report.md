## Introduction

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) represents a significant challenge in clinical practice, being a leading cause of acute liver failure and a major reason for drug withdrawal from the market (Björnsson, 2021). Establishing causality between a drug and liver injury is complex due to the absence of specific biomarkers and the need to exclude other potential causes of liver damage.

This report examines the methodologies used for DILI causality assessment, focusing on the RECAM (Regulatory Council for Drug-Induced Liver Injury) and RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) scoring systems, which are widely used tools in clinical practice for evaluating the likelihood of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

## DILI Causality Assessment Methods

Causality assessment in DILI is essential for clinical decision-making, regulatory actions, and drug safety surveillance. Several structured methods have been developed to standardize this evaluation process:

- Clinical evaluation incorporating detailed history and physical examination
- Laboratory assessment including liver function tests and markers of liver injury
- Temporal relationship between drug exposure and liver injury onset
- Assessment of alternative causes of liver injury
- Response to drug discontinuation and rechallenge when applicable

These methods help clinicians systematically evaluate the likelihood that a specific drug caused the observed liver injury.

## RECAM Scoring System

The RECAM scoring system was developed by the Spanish Regulatory Council for Drug-Induced Liver Injury to provide a standardized approach to DILI causality assessment (Björnsson et al., 2019). This system evaluates several key domains:

### Key Components:
- Temporal relationship between drug intake and liver injury
- History of previous liver disease
- Response to drug withdrawal
- Presence of alternative causes
- Risk factors for liver disease
- Previous reports of DILI with the same drug

The RECAM system assigns points based on these criteria to determine the likelihood of DILI causality, categorized as:
- Excluded
- Unlikely
- Possible
- Probable
- Highly probable

## RUCAM Scoring System

The RUCAM scoring system, originally developed by Roussel Uclaf and later updated, is one of the most widely used methods for DILI causality assessment (Danan & Benichou, 1993). The updated version (RUCAM 2016) includes:

### Assessment Domains:
- Time latency between drug intake and liver injury onset
- Course of ALT levels after drug discontinuation
- Risk factors for liver disease
- Concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs
- Search for alternative causes
- Previous information on hepatotoxicity of the drug
- Response to re-exposure (when applicable)

The scoring ranges from -5 to +15 points, with categories:
- Excluded (≤0 points)
- Unlikely (1-2 points)
- Possible (3-5 points)
- Probable (6-8 points)
- Highly probable (≥9 points)

## Comparison of Assessment Methods

Both RECAM and RUCAM provide structured approaches to DILI causality assessment, but they differ in several aspects:

| Feature | RECAM | RUCAM |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Development | Spanish Regulatory Council | Roussel Uclaf |
| Point System | Categorical scoring | Numerical scoring (-5 to +15) |
| Rechallenge Assessment | Limited emphasis | Explicit scoring item |
| Alternative Causes | Comprehensive evaluation | Dedicated scoring item |
| Clinical Application | Primarily regulatory | Broad clinical use |

The choice between these systems often depends on institutional preferences and regulatory requirements.

## Findings and Evidence

In the current assessment, insufficient patient data was provided to calculate the RECAM score, which requires specific laboratory values, clinical information, and detailed drug exposure details. This limitation highlights several important findings:

• **Data Requirements**: Accurate DILI causality assessment requires comprehensive clinical data including baseline and follow-up laboratory values
• **Temporal Relationship**: Detailed medication history with precise timing of drug exposure is essential
• **Alternative Exclusion**: Systematic evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury is mandatory
• **Clinical Context**: Patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and concomitant medications significantly influence causality assessment

These findings align with previous research emphasizing the complexity of DILI diagnosis and the necessity of structured assessment approaches (Chalasani et al., 2019).

## Conclusion on Causality

Due to the insufficient patient data provided, a definitive causality assessment using the RECAM scoring system could not be performed. The lack of specific laboratory values, clinical information, and drug exposure details prevents accurate calculation of causality scores.

However, the evidence supports that proper DILI causality assessment requires:
- Complete medication history with timing details
- Comprehensive laboratory data including liver function tests
- Evaluation of alternative causes of liver injury
- Assessment of response to drug discontinuation when applicable

Without these essential elements, any causality determination would be speculative and potentially misleading.

## Recommendations

> **Recommendation 1**: Ensure complete clinical data collection including detailed medication history, timing of exposure, and comprehensive laboratory values before attempting DILI causality assessment.

> **Recommendation 2**: Utilize standardized scoring systems such as RECAM or RUCAM to ensure systematic evaluation and reproducible results.

> **Recommendation 3**: Consider consultation with hepatology specialists when complex cases require expert evaluation of DILI causality.

> **Recommendation 4**: Document all assessment findings thoroughly to support clinical decision-making and potential regulatory reporting requirements.
