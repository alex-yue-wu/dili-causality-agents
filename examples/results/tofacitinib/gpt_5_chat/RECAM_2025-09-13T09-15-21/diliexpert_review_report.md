## Introduction

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a diagnostic challenge, requiring exclusion of competing causes, assessment of temporal relationships, and interpretation of drug-specific hepatotoxic potential (Danan & Teschke, 2019 [1]). This report evaluates the likelihood that **tofacitinib**, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was responsible for liver injury in this patient.

---

## Case Summary

- **Drug of Interest:** Tofacitinib  
- **Sex:** Female  
- **Onset of liver test abnormalities:** 32 days after initiation  
- **AST/ALT/ALP/Bilirubin values at onset:**  
  - AST: 390 U/L  
  - ALT: 450 U/L  
  - ALP: 210 U/L  
  - Bilirubin: 1.2 mg/dL  
- **Baseline values:** ALT: 22 U/L, ALP: 75 U/L, Bilirubin: 0.5 mg/dL  
- **Course after drug discontinuation:**  
  - ALT declined >50% within 19 days  
  - ALP declined >50% within 28 days  
  - Bilirubin declined >50% within 10 days  
- **Pattern of injury:** Predominantly **hepatocellular** (ALT elevation 12× baseline, R ratio >5)

---

## Clinical Data and Laboratory Findings

- **Magnitude of liver injury:**  
  - ALT elevation: 12× ULN (marked hepatocellular injury)  
  - ALP elevation: 1.7× ULN (mild, supportive of mixed component but predominately hepatocellular)  

- **Resolution after stopping drug:**  
  - Rapid decline in liver enzymes, consistent with **drug withdrawal effect** (Björnsson, 2016 [2])  

---

## Evaluation of Competing Causes

- **Viral Hepatitis:** Excluded (negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV markers; CMV, EBV, HSV serology negative)  
- **Alcohol-related injury:** No alcohol use reported  
- **Autoimmune hepatitis:** ANA/ASMA titers low; not supportive of autoimmune hepatitis  
- **Ischemia:** No evidence of hemodynamic instability  
- **Sepsis:** Absent  
- **Biliary obstruction or mass lesion:** Imaging negative  

> ✅ **Conclusion:** All major competing causes reasonably excluded.

## Causality Assessment Domains

Using the **RECAM scoring system**:

| Domain | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Domain 1: Onset Timing** | **2** | Liver injury onset within 32 days of starting tofacitinib, compatible timeframe |
| **Domain 2: Course After Stopping** | **3** | Clear enzyme decline after withdrawal (RUCAM-based weighting) |
| **Domain 3: Risk Factors / Competing Causes** | **3** | No alternative etiology identified |
| **Domain 4: Drug’s Known Potential** | **0** | Tofacitinib rarely associated with DILI; reports limited (LiverTox, 2022 [3]) |
| **Domain 5: Rechallenge / Biopsy / Prior Information** | **0** | No rechallenge; no biopsy evidence |
| **Total RECAM Score** | **8** | Indicates **Probable DILI** |

---

## Overall Conclusion

Based on temporal association, biochemical profile, and resolution following discontinuation of tofacitinib, as well as exclusion of competing etiologies, the case meets criteria for **Probable DILI**. Although tofacitinib has limited prior documentation as a hepatotoxic agent (LiverTox, 2022 [3]), the clinical evidence here strongly implicates it as the likely cause.

---

## Recommendations

> - **Avoid rechallenge** with tofacitinib due to risk of recurrent or more severe DILI.  
> - **Monitor liver function** periodically with any new therapy prescribed, especially hepatotoxic agents.  
> - **Document case** in pharmacovigilance database for future reference given rarity of tofacitinib hepatotoxicity.  
> - **Educate patient** regarding symptoms of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, dark urine).
