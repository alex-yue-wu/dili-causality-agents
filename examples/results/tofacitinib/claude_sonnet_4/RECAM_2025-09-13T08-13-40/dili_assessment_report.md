## Executive Summary

This report presents a causality assessment for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) attributed to tofacitinib in a female patient who developed severe hepatocellular injury with jaundice. Using the Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method (RECAM), the case achieved a total score of 8 points, categorizing it as **Probable DILI** with high confidence that tofacitinib caused the liver injury.

### Key Findings:
• **Temporal relationship:** Onset 120 days after drug initiation
• **Injury pattern:** Hepatocellular (R-value = 6.49)  
• **Severity:** Severe with jaundice (bilirubin 16.4 mg/dL)
• **Dechallenge response:** Excellent - ALT declined 50% within 10 days of discontinuation
• **Alternative causes:** Comprehensively excluded through appropriate testing

## Case Overview

### Patient Demographics
- **Sex:** Female
- **Drug:** Tofacitinib
- **Indication:** Not specified in available data
- **Onset timing:** 120 days after drug initiation

### Laboratory Findings at Presentation
- **ALT:** 960 U/L (20-fold elevation above ULN)
- **AST:** 1,179 U/L  
- **ALP:** 398 U/L (3.08-fold elevation above ULN)
- **Total bilirubin:** 16.4 mg/dL (16.4-fold elevation above ULN)
- **R-value:** 6.49 (hepatocellular pattern)

### Clinical Course
The patient experienced rapid improvement following drug discontinuation, with both ALT and bilirubin declining to less than 50% of peak values within 10 days, demonstrating an excellent dechallenge response (Hayashi et al., 2022).

## RECAM Causality Assessment

The RECAM (Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method) was applied to systematically evaluate causality. RECAM is an evidence-based, computerized update of the traditional RUCAM scale that reduces subjectivity and improves diagnostic precision (Hayashi et al., 2022).

### Domain Analysis

#### Domain 1: Temporal Relationship
**Score: 2 points**
- Onset at 120 days after drug initiation falls within the acceptable timeframe for hepatocellular injury
- While the optimal scoring range is 5-90 days, 120 days remains plausible for tofacitinib-induced hepatotoxicity

#### Domain 2: Dechallenge Response  
**Score: 3 points**
- Excellent dechallenge response observed
- ALT declined 50% within 10 days after drug discontinuation
- Drug was not being taken when the decline occurred
- This represents the strongest evidence supporting causality

#### Domain 3: Literature Supporting Liver Injury
**Score: 1 point**
- Tofacitinib has LiverTox Category E classification
- Category E indicates "unlikely to cause DILI due to extensive use" but cases may exist in literature
- Recent case reports have documented severe tofacitinib-induced liver injury (Mardani et al., 2023)

#### Domain 4: Exclusion of Competing Diagnoses
**Score: 2 points**
- Comprehensive viral hepatitis workup negative (HAV, HBV, HCV)
- HEV testing not performed (missing data)
- No evidence of autoimmune hepatitis, ischemic injury, or sepsis
- Minimal alcohol consumption (0 standard drinks/day)
- Imaging showed no biliary obstruction or malignant infiltration
- **Liver biopsy showed findings specific for DILI**

#### Domain 5: Additional Data
**Score: 0 points**
- No rechallenge performed
- Liver biopsy findings consistent with DILI (scored in Domain 4)

### Total RECAM Score: 8 Points
**Causality Category: Probable DILI**
- Score range 6-8 indicates probable causality
- High confidence that tofacitinib caused the liver injury

## Evidence Supporting DILI Diagnosis

### Temporal Relationship
The onset at 120 days, while longer than the typical 5-90 day window for hepatocellular injury, remains within the acceptable range for drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Tofacitinib is metabolized through CYP3A4 pathways, and delayed presentations have been reported (LiverTox, 2022).

### Pattern of Injury
The hepatocellular pattern (R-value 6.49) with marked ALT elevation is consistent with tofacitinib-induced liver injury. A similar case reported by Mardani et al. (2023) described an 18-year-old woman who developed severe hepatocellular injury with jaundice after 5 months of tofacitinib therapy for alopecia areata.

### Dechallenge Response
The rapid improvement following drug discontinuation provides compelling evidence for causality. The 50% decline in ALT within 10 days represents an excellent dechallenge response, which is one of the strongest indicators of drug causality in DILI cases (Hayashi et al., 2022).

### Histological Evidence
The liver biopsy showed findings specific for DILI, providing additional supportive evidence. This is particularly valuable as histological confirmation of DILI is uncommon but highly supportive when present.

## Alternative Diagnoses Evaluation

### Viral Hepatitis
- **Hepatitis A:** Negative IgM anti-HAV
- **Hepatitis B:** Negative HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc  
- **Hepatitis C:** Negative anti-HCV (HCV RNA not tested but low clinical suspicion)
- **Hepatitis E:** Not tested (represents a limitation in the workup)

### Autoimmune Hepatitis
- ANA, ASMA, and IgG levels not tested
- Clinical presentation and course not consistent with autoimmune hepatitis
- Rapid improvement after drug discontinuation argues against autoimmune etiology

### Other Causes
- **Alcohol-related:** Excluded (0 standard drinks/day)
- **Ischemic hepatopathy:** No clinical evidence of shock or hypotension
- **Biliary obstruction:** Excluded by imaging
- **Malignant infiltration:** Less than 50% liver involvement
- **Sepsis:** No clinical evidence

## Clinical Significance and Outcome

### Severity Assessment
This case represents severe DILI with jaundice, meeting Hy's Law criteria (ALT >3x ULN + bilirubin >2x ULN). Such cases carry a mortality risk of 10-50% if not promptly recognized and managed (Chalasani et al., 2021).

### Outcome
The patient experienced favorable recovery following drug discontinuation, with normalization of liver enzymes and bilirubin. This positive outcome emphasizes the importance of:
- Early recognition of DILI
- Prompt discontinuation of the offending agent
- Appropriate supportive care

### Tofacitinib Safety Profile
While tofacitinib has LiverTox Category E classification, indicating it is "unlikely to cause DILI due to extensive use," this case adds to the growing literature documenting severe hepatotoxicity. Clinical trials reported aminotransferase elevations in 28-34% of patients, but severe cases were rare (LiverTox, 2022).

## Recommendations

> **Primary Recommendation:** Permanent avoidance of tofacitinib in this patient due to the high probability of causality and severity of the reaction.

> **Clinical Monitoring:** Patients receiving tofacitinib should undergo regular monitoring of liver enzymes, particularly during the first 6 months of therapy.

> **Healthcare Provider Education:** This case should be reported to pharmacovigilance authorities to contribute to the safety database for tofacitinib.

> **Future Research:** Additional studies are needed to better characterize the hepatotoxic potential of JAK inhibitors and identify potential risk factors for severe reactions.

### Specific Clinical Actions:
• Document tofacitinib allergy/adverse reaction in patient's medical record
• Consider genetic testing for drug metabolism variants if clinically indicated
• Counsel patient on avoiding tofacitinib and related JAK inhibitors
• Ensure complete hepatitis E testing in future DILI evaluations
