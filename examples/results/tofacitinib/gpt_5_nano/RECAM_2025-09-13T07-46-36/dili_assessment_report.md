Executive Summary
- The presented case involves a female patient treated with tofacitinib who developed marked hepatocellular injury with substantial cholestasis (ALT 805 U/L, AST 1239 U/L, bilirubin 8.42 mg/dL) after initiation of therapy. The onset occurred within approximately 120 days of starting the drug. The absence of complete infectious hepatitis workup, autoimmune serologies, and liver histology limits the exclusion of alternative etiologies. The provided RECAM-like scoring (Domain 1: 2; Domain 2: 0; Domain 3: 0; Domain 4: 2; Domain 5: 0; total = 4) supports a classification of Possible DILI with moderate likelihood, contingent on exclusion of competing etiologies and more complete dechallenge/rechallenge data.

Case Context and Objective
- Objective: To synthesize available clinical data and apply standard causality assessment frameworks to determine the likelihood that tofacitinib caused the observed liver injury.
- Key patient data provided in the case:
  - Drug: tofacitinib
  - Onset after start: ~120 days
  - Pattern: hepatocellular with markedly elevated ALT/AST and bilirubin
  - Dechallenge/rechallenge data: not available
  - Baseline labs: not provided for ALT/AST/Bili
  - Other etiologies: infectious, autoimmune, ischemic, and biliary diseases incompletely evaluated
- Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993); (Chalasani et al., 2014)

Methods: Causality Assessment Frameworks
- Standard causality tools referenced for DILI:
  - RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) framework (Danan & Benichou, 1993). Structured scoring across temporal relationship, dechallenge, alternative causes, injury pattern, and additional considerations. This case illustrates Domain-based scoring with a total score of 4 indicating Possible DILI.
  - WHO-UMC causality framework as a complementary approach to categorize the strength of evidence (probable/possible/certain/unlikely) based on temporal relation, alternative etiologies, and evidence quality. 
  - DILI-CAT (DILI causality assessment tool) methodology as an adjunct for objective, literature-based evaluation of specific DILI features (e.g., pattern, latency, risk factors) (DILI-CAT methodology, 2015).
  - ACG Clinical Practice Guidelines for DILI, which emphasize exclusion of other etiologies and careful interpretation of laboratory patterns and clinical course (Chalasani et al., 2014).

Findings (Case Data)
- Laboratory data consistent with significant hepatocellular injury with cholestatic component:
  - ALT 805 U/L, AST 1239 U/L; Bilirubin 8.42 mg/dL; ALP 198 U/L
  - Pattern likely hepatocellular-dominant with cholestasis; compatible with DILI spectrum but non-DILI causes not fully excluded
  - Onset ~120 days after starting tofacitinib aligns with possible DILI latency ranges for other immunomodulators
- Absence/paucity of mandatory etiologic workups:
  - Viral hepatitis serologies largely missing (HBsAg, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, IgM HAV/HEV, IgM CMV/EBV/HSV)
  - Autoimmune markers (ANA/ASMA/IgG) largely missing
  - Imaging and liver biopsy data not available
  - Rechallenge data unavailable
- Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993) (Chalasani et al., 2014)

Evidence Mapping to Causality Domains (RECAM-like framework)
- Domain 1: Temporal relationship
  - Onset within ~120 days after initiation supports potential causal link; timing is plausible for DILI with immunomodulatory agents, though latency can vary. Score: 2
  - Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993)
- Domain 2: Dechallenge/Rechallenge
  - No documented dechallenge or rechallenge information; data inconclusive. Score: 0
- Domain 3: Alternative causes
  - Infectious and autoimmune workups incomplete; ischemic injury data missing; alternative etiologies cannot be reliably excluded. Score: 0
- Domain 4: Pattern of injury
  - Marked ALT/AST elevations with concurrent bilirubin elevation and hepatocellular pattern aligns with DILI in susceptible individuals on tofacitinib; supports DILI-pattern compatibility. Score: 2
  - Inline citations: (Chalasani et al., 2014) (DILI-CAT methodology, 2015)
- Domain 5: Other considerations
  - Rechallenge data and histology missing; thus, limited additional supportive information. Score: 0
- Total RECAM-like score: 4
- Interpretation: Possible DILI with moderate likelihood given hepatocellular pattern and timing, but data are incomplete for exclusion of other etiologies.

Non-DILI Evidence and Data Gaps
- Evidence that weakens or complicates attribution to DILI:
  - Viral hepatitis serologies largely missing; infectious etiologies cannot be excluded (HBV, HCV, HAV, HEV, CMV, EBV, HSV)
  - Ischemic liver injury data missing; sepsis data missing; ischemic injury cannot be ruled out
  - Autoimmune workup largely missing; autoimmune hepatitis not excluded
  - Rechallenge data not available; no documented dechallenge/rechallenge response
  - No liver biopsy results to differentiate DILI from other etiologies
  - High ALT/AST with marked bilirubin could be compatible with DILI but non-DILI causes not definitively excluded
- Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993) (ACG Guidelines, 2014) (WHO-UMC, 2020)
- Additional note: The RECAM-like scoring system in this case indicates moderate likelihood but is contingent on completing etiologic workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

Overall Causality Assessment
- Causality conclusion under RECAM-like framework:
  - Total score: 4 (Possible DILI with moderate likelihood)
  - Rationale: Temporal association present; pattern supports hepatocellular injury; lack of dechallenge/rechallenge data and incomplete exclusion of alternative etiologies limit stronger attribution.
  - Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993) (Chalasani et al., 2014) (DILI-CAT methodology, 2015)
- Additional considerations:
  - For a drug like tofacitinib (a JAK inhibitor with known hepatic safety signals in some patients), higher-quality evaluation would require complete infectious/autoimmune workup, liver biopsy if indicated, and, if safe and ethical, a cautious dechallenge/rechallenge under supervision.

Recommendations
> Based on the current evidence, the following steps are recommended to enhance causality assessment and patient safety:
- Obtain complete infectious hepatitis serologies (HBsAg, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, IgM HAV/HEV, EBV/CMV/HSV) to exclude viral etiologies.
- Obtain autoimmune workup (ANA, ASMA, IgG) to evaluate for autoimmune hepatitis.
- Consider liver imaging to assess for biliary obstruction and ischemic etiologies (if not previously performed).
- Consider liver biopsy only if results would alter management or if liver injury persists or worsens despite drug withdrawal.
- Document and monitor dechallenge response after cessation of tofacitinib if clinically feasible.
- Rechallenge should generally be avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and performed under rigorous supervision with informed consent, given the risk of severe recurrent injury.
- Inline citations: (Danan & Benichou, 1993) (ACG Guidelines, 2014) (WHO-UMC, 2020) (DILI-CAT methodology, 2015)
- Summary recommendation for clinical practice: In cases with incomplete etiologic workup, a cautious approach to attributing causality should be maintained; complete evaluation of alternative etiologies is essential for rising from Possible DILI to Probable or Definite DILI.

---

Limitations
- The primary limitation is incomplete data to exclude non-DILI etiologies, particularly infectious hepatitis serologies, autoimmune markers, functional imaging, and histology data.
- Rechallenge data is absent; the absence of dechallenge information limits causal strength.
- Inline citations reflect standard frameworks; actual application depends on full data availability and clinician judgment.
